Once you create the account for an user with email and password like you learned in the previous section, you need to create a session for the user to authenticate. The session generates a cookie that you can use to authenticate the user in the future. No worries, cookies are automatically handled by the SDK.

## Create Email Session

When you create a user with email and password, you can use the email and password to create a session for the user. The session is created with the `account.createEmailSession` method.

```dart
final session = await client.account.createEmailSession(
  email: 'user1@appwrite.io',
  password: 'password',
);
```

Once you successfully create the session, all the subsequent request from the SDK using the same `Client` instance will include the user's cookie in the request headers. This means that you don't need to manually handle the cookie.

However, this is only one of the way to create a session. You can also create an anonymous session, or create session using OAuth2, Magic Link, or Phone Number. Let's look at each of those methods.

## Create Anonymous Session

What if, you don't want to ask user for email and password? For various reasons, to reduce friction, for privacy reason or anything else. Well, Appwrite provides a way to create an anonymous session for the user. The anonymous session is created with the `account.createAnonymousSession` method. The method doesn't require any parameters.

> Note: Creating an anonymous session also creates a new anonymous user account in the Appwrite server.

```dart
final session = await account.createAnonymousSession();
```

That's it, once you create an anonymous session, all the subsequent request from the SDK using the same `Client` instance will include the new user's cookie in the request headers automatically.

## Create OAuth2 Session

Appwrite supports OAuth2 authentication. You can use the `account.createOAuth2Session` method to create a session for the user using OAuth2. The method requires the `provider` parameter. The `provider` parameter is the name of the OAuth2 provider. For example, if you want to use Google OAuth2, the `provider` parameter will be `google`.

You have to enable the provider in the Appwrite console before you can use it.

```dart
final session = await account.createOAuth2Session(provider: 'google');
```

> Note: Creating a OAuth2 session also creates a new user account if the account doesn't exist for the email associated with the OAuth2 account.

## Create Magic Link Session

Appwrite also supports Magic Link authentication. You can use the `account.createMagicURLSession` method to create a session for the user using Magic Link. The method requires the `email` parameter. The `email` parameter is the email of the user.

```dart
final session = await account.createMagicURLSession(email: 'user1@appwrite.io');
```

> Note: Creating a Magic Link session also creates a new user account if the account doesn't exist for the email.

## Create Phone Number Session

Appwrite also supports Phone Number authentication. You can use the `account.createPhoneSession` method to create a session for the user using Phone Number. The method requires the `phoneNumber` parameter. The `phoneNumber` parameter is the phone number of the user.

```dart
final session = await account.createPhoneSession(phoneNumber: '+123456789');
```

> Note: Creating a Phone Number session also creates a new user account if the account doesn't exist for the phone number.
