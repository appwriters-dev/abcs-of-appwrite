Appwrite provides a set of APIs that allow you to manage your users and their authentication. You can use the Appwrite SDKs to easily integrate these APIs into your app. You can also use the Appwrite Console to manage your users. Appwrite provides teams and roles to help you manage your users and their permissions. Appwrite's permission model is very flexible and allows you to manage your users and their permissions in a way that suits your app's needs. We will learn more about permissions in the next chapter. In this chapter we will learn to manage users, teams and authentication.
