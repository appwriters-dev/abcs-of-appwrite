Going to each link from the sidebar you can manage individual resources of your project. We will learn about all of those resources and services in their respective sections.

### Project Settings

The project settings provide information about project like the project id, API endpoint, that are later required to connect to your Appwrite services using the Appwrite SDKs and API. You can also use the settings to enable, disable the project's services like databases, authentication, and more. You can also delete the project from the settings page. Be careful when deleting a project as it will delete all the resources associated with the project and it's irreversible.
