---

If you are a developer you already know, building modern application is difficult. On top of that, building robust, secure, performant, and scalable app is even harder. You have to take care of tons of different aspects and you will have to have expertise in different areas like security, database, system design and more. This is where [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) comes in. Appwrite is working to make development of modern applications easy, fun and accessible with it’s Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform.

Appwrite is an open-source, secure and scalable BaaS that provides developers with everything they need to rapidly build robust modern applications. Appwrite is packaged as a set of docker micro services, Appwrite provides a suite of **easy-to-use** APIs, SDKs, tools to build features, not write boilerplate.

By default Appwrite already provides following services

1. Authentication and user management along with teams
2. Highly customizable database with MySQL and MariaDB integration (MongoDB coming soon)
3. Storage for buckets and files management locally or on S3 and S3 compatible object storage
4. Cloud functions with 10+ language runtime support
5. Powerful, flexible permission management
6. Webhooks to integrate with other services
7. Realtime APIs to build realtime apps
8. CLI to manage your Appwrite instance
9. and much more

We will learn about each of these services in its own dedicated chapter.

Appwrite is designed to be cross-platform and technology-agnostic, meaning we can install and run Appwrite on any system that supports Docker and Appwrite integrates well with any language and framework. Appwrite officially provides SDKs for 10+ languages and frameworks, however you can integrate it with any language and framework that can work with REST API and web-socket API. To see the list of all the official SDKs visit [https://appwrite.io/docs/sdks](https://appwrite.io/docs/sdks). Appwrite also provides up to date Swagger and Open-Api specs if you want to build your own SDK or use the REST API directly.
