Appwrite provides a unified API for managing files and images. You can upload, download, delete, and manage your files and images using the Appwrite API. You can also use the Appwrite Console to manage your files and images. Not only that Appwrite provides storage buckets where you can group your files and images with various configuration limitations, permissions, and more.
